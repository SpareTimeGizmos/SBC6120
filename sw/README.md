# SBC6120 Firmware

* BTS6120 v271 was the final release for the original SBC6120/FP6120.  271h.hex and 271l.hex are the high and low EPROM images for this version.

* BTS6120 v320 was the release for the "reduced cost" SBC6120-RC.  320h.hex and 320l.hex are the high and low EPROM images for this version.  Note that v320 does work on the original SBC6120 hardware, but was never released for that model.

* ID01.PA, VM01.PA and RO01.PA are the OS/8 handlers for the SBC6120 IDE disk, RAM disk and ROM disk, respectively.

* DATE.PA is a program to set the OS/8 date using the RTC on the IOB6120 board.
